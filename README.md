## Highlights

- Fine-tuned a Stable Diffusion model using LoRA for improved medical image representation.
- Replaces complex U-Net training with efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA) — no need to train the full denoising network from scratch.
- Enhances disease classification performance in downstream deep learning models.
- Improves model focus on disease-specific regions in chest X-rays.
- Reduces disparity and promotes fairness across demographic subgroups (e.g., age, gender, race).

## Introduction

This repository supports our AAAI 2026 submission on leveraging diffusion models for medical image understanding. We fine-tune a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using LoRA to overcome the computational cost and complexity of full U-Net retraining in medical diffusion workflows. 

Our approach targets the following core goals:

- **Classification Boost**: Generate diffusion-guided features that improve disease classification accuracy.
- **Focus Quality**: Encourage attention to disease-relevant regions through learned diffusion features.
- **Fairness and Equity**: Improve fairness across demographic attributes by reducing disparity in model outputs.

The codebase includes training scripts, inference pipelines, evaluation tools, and documentation for reproducing results on public datasets like CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR



This repository contains two core training pipelines:

- **Diffusion Training (`main_train_diffusion_model.py`)** — Fine-tunes Stable Diffusion v1.5 using LoRA on medical captions.
- **Classification Training (`main_train_classification.py`)** — Trains a ResNet-based model on real and synthetic images using CXR-CLIP features.
